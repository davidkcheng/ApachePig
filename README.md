# ApachePig

I run Hadoop jobs and writing scripts in Pig to run on the Flux Hadoop cluster to process a Yelp dataset.
For UMich student, Flux can be applied for at https://www.engin.umich.edu/form/cacaccountapplication.

For review, a tutorial on pig can be found here: http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.7.0/tutorial.html

The dataset for this project comes from the Yelp Dataset Challenge (http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/).
